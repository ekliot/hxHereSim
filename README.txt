This is a small project to try and replicate games like
Mafia or Trouble in Terrorist Town in a small, text-based
system. Currently the goals are to be able to have AI that
can act and respond to other AI appropriately, with future
plans to expand into player interaction, emergent storytelling,
and perhaps some kind of visuals.

This is currently my main focus outside of classwork,
however the free time I have to commit to this is still
negligible.
